# Hey ðŸ‘‹
This is a script for installing MacOS (Mojave) themes on Gnome desktop environment.

It's based on these projects:
- https://github.com/vinceliuice/Mojave-gtk-theme
- https://github.com/vinceliuice/McMojave-circle

Not only installing, you can use this to update the theme to the latest one. Usually there will be a bug with the theme/icons when there's a new version of Gnome release, and updating the theme can be as simple as running the script.

# Steps
## Install dependencies
If you use dnf (fedora, rhel), run `dnf install sassc optipng inkscape`

If you use apt (ubuntu and friends), run `sudo apt install sassc optipng inkscape libcanberra-gtk-module libglib2.0-dev`

## Run install script
Run `sudo ./install.sh`

The rendering might take a while. Grab a tea and watch a youtube video before coming back.

## Update your gnome tweaks setting
Now you just need to update your settings on gnome tweaks. If you haven't installed gnome tweaks yet, install it from your package manager.

Go to Appearace then change Application, Icon, and Shell.
